Mini horror adventure with RPG elements

# setting
University of Magic where our heroine has accidentally opened a portal to a terrifying shadowy dimension which pulls her mind into its harrowing depths every time she dreams.  Among the varied shadowscapes, only one thing remains constant: a distant haunted airship looming huge and silent in the infinite darkness of the sky.  She must use her waking hours to prepare herself for the tide of nightmare she battles during sleep and, in between desperate fights and flights for her life, she must explore the shadowscapes to unravel the mystery of the world she's unwittingly discovered... or created?  With luck and wit she may find a way to close the nightmare dimension off from her world, or perhaps destroy it forever. 

# engine options
1. Godot: good to learn, has relevant tutorials available, open source
2. Unity: good to learn, has relevant tutotials available, but is very closed source
3. RPG Maker MV: does what we need out of the box, but a bit arguably limiting overall
