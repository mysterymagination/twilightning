Mini horror adventure with RPG elements

# setting
Neimia Academy of Wondrous Wizardry where our heroine Jazmina Owllight is a student in her first year.  She's exceptionally bright and in an effort to impress her favorite professor she accidentally opens a portal to a terrifying shadowy dimension which pulls her mind into its harrowing depths every time she dreams.  Worse, her bunkmates and even students in her classes are beginning to experience sporadic nightmares, and some have even disappeared; those who wake report escaping fiends, and presumably those who disappear were not so lucky.  Among the varied shadowscapes, only one thing remains constant: a distant derelict haunted airship looming huge and silent in the infinite darkness of the sky.  She must use her waking hours to prepare herself for the tide of nightmare she battles during sleep and, in between desperate fights and flights for her life, she must explore the shadowscapes to unravel the mystery of the world she's unwittingly discovered... or created?  With luck and wit she may find a way to close the nightmare dimension off from her world, or perhaps destroy it forever.
